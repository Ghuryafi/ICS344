## Description
This project provides hands-on experience with offensive security controls, use of cyber deception techniques using honeypots, and security event monitoring and analysis using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, as well as optional defensive strategy development. Use of a SIEM platform to aggregate and visualize data coming from both victim and honeypot environments. Set up an attacker-victim scenario, compromise a specific service, and repeat such attacks against a honeypot emulating the targeted service. Then, utilize a SIEM platform to collect and visualize data from both the victim and honeypot environments.
